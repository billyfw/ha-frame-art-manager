# Privacy Cleanup - Summary

## Changes Made

All personal information (username "billywaldman") has been removed from files that will be committed to the public git repository.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Environment Variable Management**
- ✅ Installed `dotenv` package for .env file support
- ✅ Created `.env` file (local only, not committed) with your personal paths
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template file (committed) for other users
- ✅ Created `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` and other sensitive files

### 2. **Code Changes**
- ✅ Updated `server.js` to load environment variables from `.env` file
- ✅ Removed hardcoded fallback path with your username
- ✅ Added validation to ensure `FRAME_ART_PATH` is set in development
- ✅ Updated `package.json` to simplify dev script (no hardcoded path)

### 3. **Documentation Updates**
All documentation files updated to use placeholder paths:
- ✅ `frame_art_manager/app/README.md`
- ✅ `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- ✅ `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ `docs/START.md`
- ✅ `docs/STATUS.md`
- ✅ `docs/API.md`

### 4. **Files That Remain Local**
These files contain your personal info but are NOT committed to git:
- `.env` - Your local environment variables (excluded by `.gitignore`)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (excluded by `.gitignore`)

## Your Development Workflow

### Before (required typing path every time):
```bash
cd /Users/billywaldman/devprojects/ha-frame-art-manager/frame_art_manager/app
export FRAME_ART_PATH="/Users/billywaldman/devprojects/ha-config/www/frame_art"
npm run dev
```

### After (simpler, uses .env file):
```bash
cd /Users/billywaldman/devprojects/ha-frame-art-manager/frame_art_manager/app
npm run dev
```

The `.env` file automatically loads your `FRAME_ART_PATH`, so you don't need to set it manually anymore!

## For Other Users

When someone clones your repository, they'll:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit `.env` to set their own paths
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

## Verification

✅ **Server tested and working** - Confirmed the app runs successfully with the new setup
✅ **No personal info in git** - Verified with grep search across all tracked files
✅ **Documentation updated** - All docs now use placeholder paths
