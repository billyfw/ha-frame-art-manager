# Home Assistant URL Access and Local SSL Setup

## Overview
This setup provides a clean, secure way to reach Home Assistant (HA) both **inside** and **outside** your network using a single domain:

| Context | URL | Behavior |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| **Inside LAN** | https://art-manager.ancwbfw.com | Resolved by UniFi DNS → NGINX Proxy Manager → Home Assistant via locally trusted SSL (full padlock) |
| **Outside LAN** | https://art-manager.ancwbfw.com | GoDaddy forwards (302) → Nabu Casa remote URL (no certificate for the custom domain) |

🔒 **Local-only green padlock:** Because the mkcert CA is trusted on LAN devices, the internal reverse proxy can present a valid certificate for `art-manager.ancwbfw.com`. That padlock is expected to disappear when you leave the network because GoDaddy’s forwarding cannot present a matching certificate for the custom hostname. This isnt fixable according to chatgpt without additional tools like cloudflare or exposing internal ports, because doing the ssl thing on godaddy means you can't use forwarding to send to a specific path.

The same URL therefore “just works” at home and remotely.

Off-LAN: GoDaddy DNS + forwarding sends traffic to  
https://kmxagapau1yzoflurif8li6nmfqbzeje.ui.nabu.casa/e2a3b0cb_frame_art_manager.

## Components
- **GoDaddy DNS / Forwarding** – Handles public access with a *temporary (302)* redirect to Nabu Casa.
- **UniFi Local DNS Override** – Maps the same hostname to the HA IP for LAN users.
- **NGINX Proxy Manager Add-on** – Provides internal reverse-proxy, HTTPS termination, and redirect to the HA subpath.
- **mkcert** – Generates a locally-trusted certificate for the LAN domain.

### Why remote HTTPS stays “Not Secure”
- GoDaddy forwarding only offers a 302 redirect; it does **not** terminate TLS for `art-manager.ancwbfw.com`, so browsers never see a valid cert for that hostname when you are off-LAN.
- Nabu Casa serves content under its own wildcard certificate (`*.ui.nabu.casa`), which is why the browser swaps to that hostname after the redirect.
- To keep `https://art-manager.ancwbfw.com` green on the open internet, you would need either:
      - A proxy that can present a trusted certificate while forwarding traffic (e.g., Cloudflare in front of Home Assistant), **or**
      - Directly exposing your Home Assistant/Nginx proxy to the internet with appropriate port forwarding and a public CA-issued certificate.

Those trade-offs are outside the scope of this local-only setup; the current approach intentionally keeps Home Assistant unexposed while still providing a trusted experience on the LAN.

## SSL and Certificates

| File | Purpose | Git policy |
|-------|----------|------------|
| art-manager.ancwbfw.com.pem | Public server certificate | ✅ Commit OK |
| art-manager.ancwbfw.com-key.pem | Private key used by NPM | ❌ Never commit |
| rootCA.pem | Public mkcert CA (trust on other devices) | ✅ Commit OK |
| rootCA-key.pem | mkcert CA private key | ❌ Never commit |

## How Local HTTPS Works
- The mkcert CA is installed and trusted on each LAN device.
- NGINX Proxy Manager uses the mkcert-issued cert to terminate HTTPS.
- Browsers see a valid padlock when connecting to https://art-manager.ancwbfw.com.
- Internally, NGINX proxies unencrypted traffic to homeassistant:8123.

## Security Model
| Scope | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Public Internet** | None—HA not exposed externally | GoDaddy only redirects to Nabu Casa |
| **Local LAN** | Low risk of key exposure; could allow impersonation if attacker already on LAN | Keep private key off GitHub; store in 1Password |
| **Data in GitHub** | GitHub auto-scans for keys | Only commit public certs / scripts |

**Private key storage:** keep in 1Password (or any password manager) as an attached file or secure note.  
**Never push private keys or mkcert CA keys to Git.**

## Trusted-Device Setup
### macOS
```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain rootCA.pem
```

### iOS / iPadOS
1. Convert: `openssl x509 -in rootCA.pem -outform der -out rootCA.cer`
2. AirDrop/email rootCA.cer to device
3. Settings → Profile Downloaded → Install
4. Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → Enable Full Trust

## Maintenance
- **Renew local cert** anytime via  
  ```bash
  mkcert art-manager.ancwbfw.com
  ```
- **Re-upload** to NGINX Proxy Manager → select new cert → restart add-on.
- **No public renewal needed**—Nabu Casa manages its own certs.

## Summary
You now have:
- Split-horizon DNS for a unified HA domain
- Seamless LAN vs. WAN routing
- Local HTTPS with mkcert-trusted certs
- Secure handling of private keys outside Git
- GitHub limited to public certs + trust-install scripts
