# Frame Art Editing Chat — 2025-10-19

A transcript of the working session discussing image editing for the Frame Art library.

## Conversation Timeline

1. **User:** It would be nice to add basic image editing functions to the image detail modal… [describes desired backup strategy, asks about alternatives and JPEG capabilities].
2. **Assistant:** Outlined implementation paths (non-destructive adjustments, destructive export, server-assisted) and compared backup strategies; clarified JPEG cannot hold multiple full-res images internally.
3. **User:** Asked for more detail on sidecar metadata.
4. **Assistant:** Explained sidecar file structure, lifecycle, pros/cons, and tooling tips.
5. **User:** Clarified preference for their strategy (copy to `_original` in an `/originals` folder), listed required edits (crop, brightness/contrast, filters), described toolbar behavior, revert flow, atomic file operations, and avoiding metadata updates.
6. **Assistant:** Began recommending features and implementation notes (state machine, file layout, atomic operations, syncing, locking, performance) before user interrupted.
7. **User:** Noted accidental stop and typo (“my strategy”).
8. **Assistant:** Restated suggestions, covering feature gaps, implementation notes (state handling, filesystem layout, atomic ops, sync integration, alerting, locking, performance), revert specifics, and future extras.
9. **User:** Trimmed feature list (no per-control reset, no keyboard nudges), clarified sync expectations (only `_original` file operations must complete before state change), lightweight alerts, no locking, cautious revert metadata, optional caching, and orphan cleanup during sync.
10. **Assistant:** Confirmed adjustments and readiness to implement when approved.
11. **User:** Asked for clarification on “Be conservative with revert metadata churn…”.
12. **Assistant:** Explained that revert should touch only the image files to avoid large syncs.
13. **User:** Approved plan and requested implementation with unit/integration tests, instructing assistant to pause if metadata updates become necessary.
14. **Assistant:** Started exploring repository for implementation context (no direct response recorded in notes; internal exploration commenced).
15. **User:** Reported being in the wrong workspace and asked how to keep chat while switching.
16. **Assistant:** Suggested switching workspaces while keeping conversation here.
17. **User:** Noted chat disappears on workspace switch and planned to copy/paste context.
18. **Assistant:** Encouraged moving to new workspace and providing context after switching.
19. **User:** Requested a Markdown file capturing the chat to reuse in the correct workspace (current instruction).
20. **Assistant:** Created this transcript file to transfer into the new workspace.

## Next Steps (when in correct workspace)

- Recreate the plan and implementation in the target repository using this transcript.
- Implement edit toolbar, file backup/revert behavior, and associated tests per agreed strategy.
